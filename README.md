# 🚀 Jenkins Setup on Ubuntu EC2

This project demonstrates how to install and configure **Jenkins on an Ubuntu EC2 instance** and access the Jenkins dashboard through port `8080`.


📌 Steps
## 1️⃣ Create Ubuntu EC2 Instance

Create a simple Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS.

Once the instance is running, connect to it using SSH.

```text
ssh -i <key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>

```

## 2️⃣ Install Java ☕

Jenkins is a Java-based application, so Java needs to be installed before installing Jenkins.

Update Packages

First, update the Ubuntu package repository to get the latest package information.

```text
sudo apt update

```

Install Java 17

Install OpenJDK 17, which is required to run Jenkins.
```text
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre
```
## Verify Java Installation

Check whether Java has been installed successfully.
```text
java -version

```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

```text
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

## Check Jenkins Port 🔌

By default, Jenkins runs on port 8080.

Check whether Jenkins is listening on port 8080:

Jenkins uses port 8080 by default for its web interface. Therefore, browser requests need to reach port 8080 on the EC2 instance.
**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

1. EC2 > Instances > Click on
2. In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
3. Security groups
4. Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed All traffic).

💡 Why is this required?

AWS Security Groups act as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances.

Allowing port 8080 enables traffic from the browser to reach the Jenkins service running on the EC2 instance.

## 7️⃣ Access Jenkins 🌐

After allowing port 8080 in the Security Group, open Jenkins in a web browser.

Use the following URL:

```text
http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:8080
```
🎉 The Jenkins setup page should now be displayed.

## 8️⃣ Get Initial Jenkins Admin Password 🔐

When Jenkins is installed for the first time, it generates an initial administrator password.

Retrieve the password using:

```text
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Copy the password from the terminal and enter it on the Jenkins setup page.

💡 Why do we need this password?

Jenkins uses this temporary password to securely unlock the Jenkins dashboard during the first-time setup.

## 9️⃣ Complete Jenkins Setup ⚙️

Click on Install suggested plugins. Jenkins will install the commonly used plugins required for a basic Jenkins setup.

Wait for the Jenkins to Install suggested plugins

## Create Admin User

Create the first Jenkins administrator account by providing:

Username
Password
Full Name
Email Address

✅ Complete Setup

After creating the admin user, complete the setup process. Once the setup is completed, the Jenkins Dashboard will be available.

Jenkins is now successfully installed and configured on an Ubuntu EC2 instance. Jenkins can now be accessed using:

```text
http://35.174.115.40:8080/
```
